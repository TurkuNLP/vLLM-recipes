This is a basic inference setup for a single node inference on Lumi. 

In runSlurm.sh you need to adjust the correct project name, as well as GPU's needed.

In vLLM_inference.py you at least need to adjust cache directory to specify folder where you want the model to be downloaded. 

Make sure to update Openai python library. "Pip install --upgrade --user openai"
